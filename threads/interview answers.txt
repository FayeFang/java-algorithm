Deadlocks -- the situation where a thread is waiting for an object lock that another
thread holds, and this second thread is waiting for an object lock that the first thread
holds. Since each thread is waiting for the other thread to relinquish a lock, they both
remain waiting forever.

Thread is within a process and share many data or memories.
Thread is a particular execution path of a process.
